# Natural language to SQL Query

In this application, I used Google Gemini API to convert the natural language to SQL query and retrieve data from the SQLite database.

## Installation

First, need to activate the Python virtual environment and then run the sql.py file to insert data in the database. Then run the app.py using streamlit which creates a localhost in the browser with an interface.

```bash
python sql.py
streamlit run app.py
```
